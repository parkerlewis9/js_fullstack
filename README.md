The League is a site developed at the request of Parker's 6-year-old nephew who has a intense interest in basketball and the NBA. The site allows users to log in via Facebook, Twitter, Google, or locally. Once logged in users can create a team and begin adding players (while checking their stats and comparing them to other players first) to the team via the Pro Basketball API. Users can edit and delete their own teams, but only view other's teams. Technologies used to build this application include Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, Bootstrap, and a Google image API.
